All messages are sent in stringified arrays, like [{"m":"hi"}]
Normal clients will never send more than one message per array, but some bot clients do.

Messages the client sends to the server:
    hi:
        - This is the first thing the client sends to the server.
        - No fields get sent with "hi".
        - The server responds back with its own "hi" message containing information for the client.
        Example: {"m":"hi"}
    
    devices:
        - This is sent immediately after hi and I think when devices are added or removed.
        - "list" is a field always sent with this, I think it's a list of connected midi devices but I don't know, I don't have any and have never seen this array contain anything myself.
        - As far as I know, the server never uses these messages or responds to it. Maybe it's used for analytics?
        Example: {"m":"devices","list":[]}

    ch:
        - This is sent once the client has received "hi" back from the server.
        - "_id" is a field always sent with this, containing a string of channel name the client is trying to join.
        - "set" is a field always sent with this, containg an object of settings to give the new channel.
        - The server responds with a "ch" message giving information about the channel they just joined.
        Example: {"m":"ch","_id":"this is a new room","set":{"visible":false,"color":"#0066ff"}}
    
    chset:
        - This is sent when the client changes the settings in the channel
        - "set" is a field always sent with this, containing an object of settings to change.
        - The server responds by sending "ch" to everyone in the room, updating them with the new settings.
        Example: {"m":"chset","set":{"no cussing":true,"color2":"#ff9900"}}

    n:
        - This is sent when the client plays notes.
        - "t" is a field of when the notes should be played, it's a number of milliseconds since 1970.
        - "n" is a field of an array of notes that receiving clients should play.
            - note starts are like this: {"n":"c7","v":1,d:100}
                - "n" is a field of the note that should starts
                - "v" is the velocity, this is a float between 0 - 1
                - "d" is an optional field of the delay, this is added to "t" sent with the note message to get the actual start time.
                    - if "d" is not present, it is treated like 0 by the clients.
            - note stops are like this: {"n":"c7","s":1,d:100}
                - "n" is a field of the note that should starts
                - "s" is always 1, this is how the client knows it's a note stop.
                - "d" is an optional field of the delay, this is added to "t" sent with the note message to get the actual start time.
                    - if "d" is not present, it is treated like 0 by the clients.
        - The server responds by sending a note message to every client in the room except the sender.
        Example: {"m":"n","t":1613972082283,"n":[{"n":"c7","v":0.5},{"n":"c7","s":1,"d":50}]}

    a:
        - This is sent when clients send a chat message.
        - "message" is a field of a string to send.
        - The server responds by sending a chat message to every client in the room.
        Example: {"m":"a","message":"hi I am a human"}

        Example: {"m":"+ls"}

    -ls:
        - This is sent when the client closes the room list.
        - The server will stop updating the client with room changes once this is sent.
        Example: {"m":"-ls"}

    userset:
        - This is sent when the client changes their name.
        - "set" is a field sent with this as an object like {"name":"aeiou"}
            - Only the name field is sent with this, presumably "color" used to be sent as well when people could change their colors.
        - The server responds by updating everyone in the room with a "p" message.
        Example: {"m":"userset","set":{"name":"not a bot"}}

    t:
        - This is sent every 20 seconds so the client can sync their time with the server to make sure that notes play at the correct time.
        - "e" is a field sent with this containing the client's current Date.now() when the message was sent.
        - The server responds by sending "t" back to the client.
        Example: {"m":"t","e":1613972565299}

    m:
        - This is sent every 50 milliseconds while the client is moving their mouse.
        - "x" is a field containing a string or number (browsers usually send strings, bots usually send numbers) of the cursor's x position as a float between 0 - 100.
        - "y" is a field containing a string or number (browsers usually send strings, bots usually send numbers) of the cursor's y position as a float between 0 - 100.
        - The server responds by sending "m" to every client in the room except the sender.
        Example: {"m":"m","x":"50.25","y":"73.85"}

    bye:
        - Normal clients never send this.
        - No fields are sent with this.
        - The server closes the client's socket connection when this is sent.
        - Be extremely careful that you don't keep handling messages if this is sent in an array with more messages after it. The original site and many clones have issues with sending messages after "bye".
            - An example of something that can mess up the original site is [{"m":"bye"},{"m":"ch","_id":"lobby"}]
        Example: {"m":"bye"}

        - "_id" is a field sent with this of the _id of the user to ban.
        - "ms" is a field sent with this of the number of milliseconds to ban that person, between 0 - 3600000

        - Clients send this when you drop the crown or give it to someone else.
        - "id" is a field containing the id (NOT THE SAME AS _id) of the person to give the crown to.

    unban:
        - Normal clients never send this, but bots sometimes do.
